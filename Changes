Revision history for Perl extension Net::Z3950::SimpleServer

0.08  Mon Jun 14 14:51:01 2004
	- SimpleServer is now perl 5.8 thread proof 
	- Support for IMP_ID parameter in Init responses.  This was
	  actually written a long time ago, but left commented out as
	  the underlying YAZ back-end server didn't support
	  implementation-ID setting.  Now that it does (and has done
	  for eighteen months -- since YAZ release 1.8.6 of
	  2002/03/25!), I've finally removed the comments.
	- Init handler now understands the setting of {ERR_CODE} as
	  more than a boolean success indicator, and also {ERR_STR}.
	  They are now passed back to the client (thanks to recent
	  changes to the YAZ generic front-end server) in accordance
	  with Z39.50 Implementor Agreement 5, found at
		http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/agree/initdiag.html

0.07  Fri Jan 03 10:12:15 2003
        - Applied Dave Mitchell's (davem@fdgroup.com) GRS-1 parsing patch.
	  Thanks Dave, and sorry it didn't find its way to release 0.06,
	  completely my fault.

0.06  Thu Jan 02 11:15:01 2003
        - Added support for authentication
	- Add documentation for the object tree passed as the RPN
	  member of the search-handler's argument hash.
	- We actually removed the vacuous Changelog and TODO files
	  back in 0.05.  They should never have been here :-)

0.05  Tue Feb 05 21:54:30 2002
        - Add brief documentation of the new handling
	  of RPN.

0.04  Tue Feb 05 21:49:56 2002
	- Add Changelog (### Why?  We already have this file!)
	- Add TODO file (although it's empty!)
	- Change interface to constructor, and fix test.pl script to
	  use the new interface.
	- Add support for Scan.
	- Add support for building GRS-1 records.
	- Add grs_test.pl test suite for new GRS-1 code.
	- Add RPN structure to search-handler argument hash.
	- Add PID element to init, search, fetch and present-handler
	  argument hashes (but not the sort, scan and close-handlers,
	  for some reason.)
	- Fix typos in documentation.

0.03  Thu Nov 09 16:22:00 2000
	- Add the INSTALL file.
	- Add support for a present-handler (distinct from fetch).
	- Remove `$args->{LEN} = length($record)' from the example
	  fetch-handler in the documentation.
	- Minor corrections to documentation, e.g. add commas after
	  elements in anonymous hash of arguments.
	- Record syntaxes (formats) are now specified as ASCII OIDs
	  (e.g. "1.2.840.10003.5.10") rather than human-readable
	  strings (e.g. "usmarc")
	- Add some XS code to support sorting, though it doesn't seem
	  to be finished yet, and is not wired out.
	- Use symbolic constants (e.g. Z_ElementSetNames_generic
	  instead of hard-wired magic number 1).
	- Add PEER_NAME element to init-handler argument hash.
	- Minor changes to ztest.pl.
