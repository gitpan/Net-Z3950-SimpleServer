Revision history for Perl extension Net::Z3950::SimpleServer

1.01  Fri Mar 24 12:09:32 GMT 2006
	- Documentation of release 1.00's SRU/SRW facilities.
	- Makefile.PL now fails if YAZ version is earlier than 2.0.0,
	  which was the first with SRU/SRW support.

1.00  Fri Mar 24 01:20:24 GMT 2006
	- Support for SRU and SRW.  Mostly this is provided by the YAZ
	  GFS, but changes are needed to allow for the case where
	  there is no RPN query (due to absent on invalid <cql2rpn>
	  element in GFS configuration) so that CQL is passed through
	  natively; and also to fake up an {REQ_FORM} and {REP_FORM}
	  parameters set to the "text/xml" OID when this information
	  is not specified by the GFS.
	  (The jump in version number is due to the SRU/W support.)
	- Include "logging-server.pl" in the distribution: the
	  simplest possible SimpleServer application, which merely
	  logs the client-request data structures.
	- Makefile.PL is more helpful if yaz-config isn't found.
	- Explicitly disable prototypes in SimpleServer.xs: makes no
	  difference but suppresses an error message for a cleaner
	  build.

0.08  Mon Jun 14 14:51:01 2004
	- SimpleServer is now perl 5.8 thread proof 
	- Support for IMP_ID parameter in Init responses.  This was
	  actually written a long time ago, but left commented out as
	  the underlying YAZ back-end server didn't support
	  implementation-ID setting.  Now that it does (and has done
	  for eighteen months -- since YAZ release 1.8.6 of
	  2002/03/25!), I've finally removed the comments.
	- Init handler now understands the setting of {ERR_CODE} as
	  more than a boolean success indicator, and also {ERR_STR}.
	  They are now passed back to the client (thanks to recent
	  changes to the YAZ generic front-end server) in accordance
	  with Z39.50 Implementor Agreement 5, found at
		http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/agree/initdiag.html

0.07  Fri Jan 03 10:12:15 2003
        - Applied Dave Mitchell's (davem@fdgroup.com) GRS-1 parsing patch.
	  Thanks Dave, and sorry it didn't find its way to release 0.06,
	  completely my fault.

0.06  Thu Jan 02 11:15:01 2003
        - Added support for authentication
	- Add documentation for the object tree passed as the RPN
	  member of the search-handler's argument hash.
	- We actually removed the vacuous Changelog and TODO files
	  back in 0.05.  They should never have been here :-)

0.05  Tue Feb 05 21:54:30 2002
        - Add brief documentation of the new handling
	  of RPN.

0.04  Tue Feb 05 21:49:56 2002
	- Add Changelog (### Why?  We already have this file!)
	- Add TODO file (although it's empty!)
	- Change interface to constructor, and fix test.pl script to
	  use the new interface.
	- Add support for Scan.
	- Add support for building GRS-1 records.
	- Add grs_test.pl test suite for new GRS-1 code.
	- Add RPN structure to search-handler argument hash.
	- Add PID element to init, search, fetch and present-handler
	  argument hashes (but not the sort, scan and close-handlers,
	  for some reason.)
	- Fix typos in documentation.

0.03  Thu Nov 09 16:22:00 2000
	- Add the INSTALL file.
	- Add support for a present-handler (distinct from fetch).
	- Remove `$args->{LEN} = length($record)' from the example
	  fetch-handler in the documentation.
	- Minor corrections to documentation, e.g. add commas after
	  elements in anonymous hash of arguments.
	- Record syntaxes (formats) are now specified as ASCII OIDs
	  (e.g. "1.2.840.10003.5.10") rather than human-readable
	  strings (e.g. "usmarc")
	- Add some XS code to support sorting, though it doesn't seem
	  to be finished yet, and is not wired out.
	- Use symbolic constants (e.g. Z_ElementSetNames_generic
	  instead of hard-wired magic number 1).
	- Add PEER_NAME element to init-handler argument hash.
	- Minor changes to ztest.pl.

0.02  Mon Sep 11 12:32:00 2000
	- First released versions

0.01  Wed Aug 30 14:54:01 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19
