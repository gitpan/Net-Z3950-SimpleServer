Revision history for Perl extension Net::Z3950::Server.

0.05  Tue Feb 05 21:54:30
        - Add brief documentation of the new handling
	  of RPN.

0.04  Tue Feb 05 21:49:56 
	- Add Changelog (### Why?  We already have this file!)
	- Add TODO file (although it's empty!)
	- Change interface to constructor, and fix test.pl script to
	  use the new interface.
	- Add support for Scan.
	- Add support for building GRS-1 records.
	- Add grs_test.pl test suite for new GRS-1 code.
	- Add RPN structure to search-handler argument hash.
	- Add PID element to init, search, fetch and present-handler
	  argument hashes (but not the sort, scan and close-handlers,
	  for some reason.)
	- Fix typos in documentation.

0.03  Thu Nov 09 16:22:00
	- Add the INSTALL file.
	- Add support for a present-handler (distinct from fetch).
	- Remove `$args->{LEN} = length($record)' from the example
	  fetch-handler in the documentation.
	- Minor corrections to documentation, e.g. add commas after
	  elements in anonymous hash of arguments.
	- Record syntaxes (formats) are now specified as ASCII OIDs
	  (e.g. "1.2.840.10003.5.10") rather than human-readable
	  strings (e.g. "usmarc")
	- Add some XS code to support sorting, though it doesn't seem
	  to be finished yet, and is not wired out.
	- Use symbolic constants (e.g. Z_ElementSetNames_generic
	  instead of hard-wired magic number 1).
	- Add PEER_NAME element to init-handler argument hash.
	- Minor changes to ztest.pl.
